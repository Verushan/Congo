# Congo AI

**Congo AI** is an artificial intelligence agent designed to play the chess variant **Congo**, created by Demian Frey. The game is played on a 7Ã—7 board and features animal-themed pieces with unique movement and capture rules. This project implements game logic and an AI capable of playing against a human or another AI.

## Features

- Full implementation of Congo game rules
- Command-line interface
- Move validation, piece movement, and win condition checking
- Turn-based game loop

## Getting started
To understand the structure that the code takes in the game state, refer to the in.txt file located inside cmake-build-debug.
This is giving the agent the current board state and out comes the current state shown in the out.txt
